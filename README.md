AI Ethics Institute – AIEthicsTeam
The AI Ethics Institute empowers organizations to deploy AI responsibly by providing tools for transparency, accountability, and ethical alignment.

Phase 1 – AI Black Box:
A universal monitoring system that records AI decisions — inputs, outputs, parameters, and metadata — enabling auditability, model drift detection, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder trust. Works across all major AI frameworks without modifying existing code.

Phase 2 – AI Ethics & Alignment:
Expanding into ethical evaluation, bias audits, model behavior verification, and collaboration with policymakers and enterprises to ensure AI aligns with human values and ethical standards.

Our vision is to make AI trustworthy, auditable, and ethically responsible for developers and society.
